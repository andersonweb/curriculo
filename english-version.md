## About me
I'm a front-end developer for 2 years. I've started to coding in 2013, but I delved under web development in 2014, when I decided to live in this way. I'm a Linux user and I feel comfortable to work with it because it offered me specific functionalities that help me to do great web development works. However, I can work with other operational systems, no problem for me. I really love good videos and I fell in love for help the community. :smiley:
